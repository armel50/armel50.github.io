<p>One of the main reasons why I decided to learn how to code was that, I love to be challenged. We could all agree that, sitting in front of screen for 5hours+ is already challenging enough. Some people would even be  discouraged just by considering this idea. But keep in mind; "If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great." Tom Hanks</p>

   That's right! I finally built my[ first CLI application](https://github.com/armel50/cheapest_gas.CLI) and I thought that would be intersting to share my  10 hours of coding experience with all the developers out there. 
	 
This CLI application has been designed to work like a ruby gem. It was in a world where people, strive to spend less in order to accomplish great things that, this gem saw the light. The ***CheapestGasCLI*** will provide its users with all the cheapest gas stations near them.  Although this description would be sufficient enough for the average user to undertand what this CLI is really about, there is no doubt that, a developer, by reading this description would start to ask questions such as **How? and WHAT?** and so on. Without further due, let's answer those questions. 

Have you ever heard of Web Scraping?  A simple definition would be : "A technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort." [Julia Koh](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460). Thus, this gem uses the Web Scraping technique through the mean of [Nokogiri](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri) and [OpenURI](https://rubygems.org/gems/open_uri_redirections). Believe it or not, scraping the web for data is not the hardest part of the job. In fact, In order to find wich data someone needs, he or she will first have to find the right website to be scraped. for example, Facebook and LinkedIn are two highly popular sites that many people are interested in getting data from. However, both these sites block automated web crawling via their robots.txt file and LinkedInâ€™s legal disputes with companies that have scraped data off them have been a hot topic on business/tech media outlets. It would be safe and ethical to not try to crawl these sites. [read more](https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/common-web-scraping-questions-answered/).

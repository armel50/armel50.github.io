Finally there!<br>

   This was a journey charged with a lot of new materials we had to learn and master ASAP, but this is finally over!

	As one may have guessed, this coding journey ended with a final React and Redux project. 
	Before I even dive into my project let's dicuss how I perceived these technologies. <br> 
	<h2> React</h2>
	React is really easy to grasp. In fact, after a couple weeks with React, many people will start thinking that React is one of  the best technologies out there to make web app. Among many of its strengths, the most popular are: speed, hot reload, and components features. In one word, React is Amazing!   <br> 
Redux, on the other hand is another story.  
<h2> Redux</h2>
Like many programmer, this is how I felt the first time I saw Redux:

Fortunately, after hours and hours of practice it all started to click. Really, the hardest part of learning Redux is the set up, but once this step is knocked out of the way Redux becomes as easy as any other technology. <br>
Redux was purposely designed for state management, but such  framework is not required to learn React. Redux will mostly come into play as React project gets bigger and bigger.  <br>
With that being said, let's dive into my final project. 
<h2> Project: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j78QL355IkA&feature=youtu.be'>U_Shop</a></h2>
<h4> Description</h4>
U_Shop is a simple representation of e-commerce sites. From the demo, one can agree that the design is simple but still attractive. Such design was made possible through Semantic UI; a modern front-end development framework, powered by jQuery. <br>
Also, as part of the Requirements, U_Shop makes asynchronous requests to a Ruby Api designed from scratch to retrieve data.<br> 
While this app is Single Page App (SPA), U_Shop makes use of React-Router to make it seem that it has multiple pages.<br> 
If you are interested in how this app really works, you can always clone the repo through <a href='https://github.com/armel50/u_shop'>GitHub.</a> <br>
<h4> Purpose </h4>
U_Shop was designed to provide the user with a much more enjoyable experience shoping online. Considering how fast this app reacts to changes, and also some funny contents designed to avoid users' frustration, U_Shop met its goal.

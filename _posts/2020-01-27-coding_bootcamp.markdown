<h2>Introduction</h2>
Coding is not an easy task, espacially when one person decides to learn on his/her own. 
For some people, writing code is a way to get some money, make some passive income to get to a certain level in their lives. For others, coding is a passion, a way to express one's creativity. You may have guessed that I fall in the second category. I first came across a coding challenge two years ago when one of my cousins asked me to make a piramid of asteriscs in C. Since then I fell in love with coding. Althoug I was able to build considerable skills in those two years, I was not confident enough to use them in the real word. This was probably the main reason why I joined Flatiron School. This blog is intended to give tips, dos and don'ts while attending a coding bootcamp.
<h2>Before The Coding Bootcamp</h2>
Like I said earlier, coding is hard, and bootcamps don't make it easier. Attending a coding bootcamp can be mentally and intellectually draining. Beside the mental drain, those bootcamps are not free. With that being said, before deciding whether or not to go to a coding bootcamp, make sure you get some kind of coding experience. Personally, before going to Flatiron School, I had some experience with Java, C, C++, JavaScript, jQuery, Node Js and so on. Of course this is not necessary to attend a coding bootcamp, but having some kind of experience shows that you won't give up easly when things get tougher. 
<h2>During The BootCamp</h2>
Let's be real here. If you are attending a bootcamp and you have trouble with time management, you will fail whithout any doubt. Most of those bootcamp out there offers part time and full time programs. Make sure you make the right decision.  Also, I heard a lot of people saying that it was impossible to attend a bootcamp and have a job at the same time. This is not true at all. At the time, I was attending to Flatiron, I was going to school full time and working at a job thirthy-six hours. My secret? time management! Now, was it easy? Heck no, but I mananged to do good in school, get done with the coding curriculum and get a promotion at my job.  Although this experience was a success for me, I do not recommend this path to anyone. The path I chosed was not without a price. I had to give up on my social life, and sacrifice many other things. If This sounds too much for you already, just try to take it slow. The bottom line is that time management will set you up for  succesfull carreer. 
Also, when you are attending your coding bootcamp, remember that there is a lot of people like you, going through the same struggle. Thus, this would be the perfect time for you to build a network that will come in handy in your job search process.
<h2>After The Coding Bootcamp</h2>
Congratulation! If you got thus far that means that you're ready to get in the real world and start hussling like the rest of us. While you're trying to get a job, do not forget to code some more. Keep your skills as sharp as possible. The best way to do so would be to work on some project on your own. For instance, After my coding bootcamp, I worked on projects with some friends abroad to hone my React and Redux skills.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Thanks for reading my blog. I hope I was able to bring some light on what to expect of coding bootcamps. Happy Hacking!
